## Assumptions and Considerations
1. Authentication:
    The project assumes a basic authentication mechanism using Redux Toolkit and localStorage.
    Tokens are stored in localStorage for simplicity (not recommended for production).

2. Styling:
    Tailwind CSS is used for styling. Ensure the tailwind.config.js file is properly configured.

3. Routing:
    React Router is used for navigation. Protected routes are implemented using a PrivateRoutes component.
    
4. State Management:
    Redux Toolkit is used for managing global state (e.g., authentication, user data).
